# theBetterArmApi

A link consists of one of more functions with in a method these functions
are to separate the methods being send to the link and are to ensure that
if one method doesn't work the other one will continue to function as normal.

To change the way a function works simply go to the link bound method and
change the code inside the function named after the methods you want to change.

The index template is a testing environment and as a example file to show
how http request will have to be send. However the API will work fine if
you completely remove the templates folder.
